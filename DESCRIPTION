Title: Tools to Work with the 'Rosette' API
Version: 0.1.0

Description: 'Rosette' text analytics is a robust toolkit for processing language,
    documents, and names. Eighty-percent of big data exists as unstructured text, found 
    in documents, webpages, and databases. This unstructured text is also multilingual — 
    less than 6% of the world’s population are native English speakers — only adding to 
    the complexity. The 'Rosette' API enables extraction of entities and relationships,
    translation and comparison of names, plus sentiment analysis.
